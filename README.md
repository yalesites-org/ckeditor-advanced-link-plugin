# CKEditor Modified Link Plugin

This is a fork of the [CKEditor Link plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/link) that changes the icon and title text of the toolbar icon to be more clear in what this plugin does as compared to the default Drupal link plugin.

This plugin allows content editors to easily add email and phone links without knowing the proper syntax.

To make additional changes:

1) Change the title text of the button: Edit the ```toolbar setting``` in the ```/lang/en.js``` file.
2) Change the icon: Change the icon ```/icons/link.png```. This must be a 16x16 png image with a transparent background.
